LaTeX
=====

Most of the mathematics are only available in LaTeX form at the moment. PDF files have to be built from source.

The directory for mathematical definitions (.tex) and bibliography (.bib) is::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight/doc/latex

Install from the universe repository (same as :doc:`dev_doc`)::

    $ sudo apt-get install texlive

First run pdflatex to create the bcf file. If there is an aux file already, delete it::

    $ rm ./filename.aux
    $ pdflatex ./filename.tex

Then run bibtex on the bcf file (Don't add the file extension)::

    $ bibtex ./filename.aux

Create the PDF (You may have to run twice)::

    $ pdflatex ./filename.tex
