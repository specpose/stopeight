Sample-Data
-----------

Legacy pen stroke test data can be found in the repository stopeight-clibs. Any arc-wise connected series of 2D points can be loaded. The sample data has been hand-drawn on a Wacom Cintiq 21UX and plain mouse using Symboloh. It is currently the only test-set available.

It has to be extracted from here::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy/test-data
    $ tar xvfz v0-1-0.tar.gz

Or use the zip file (v0-1-0.zip) instead.

Pen-Stroke and Vector Graph data in the new format is automatically generated in the ~/.stopeight directory if a editor algorithm fails. It can also be saved from the editor menu.
