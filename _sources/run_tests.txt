Stopeight Comparator
--------------------

The API is installed with stopeight.

To run the tests using the legacy frontend pooling is needed.

:mod:`stopeight.multiprocessing` is using the Python multiprocessing module. You can test if your Python installation and the underlying OS support this by running from within a Python shell::

    >>> from multiprocessing import synchronize

Unpack the legacy test files::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy/tests
    $ tar xvfz v0-1-0.tar.gz

Run the tests::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight
    $ python -m stopeight.tests.parser stopeight-clibs/legacy/tests/
