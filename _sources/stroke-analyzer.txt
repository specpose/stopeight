Stroke Analyzer
===============

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note: Needs qt4-core and qt4-gui::

    $ sudo apt-get install libqt4-core
    $ sudo apt-get install libqt4-gui

Analyzing pen-strokes from a 2D input device.
---------------------------------------------

The stroke analyzer is part of stopeight-clibs-legacy. Get::

    $ git clone https://github.com/fassio/stopeight-clibs.git

Run qmake to generate the Makefile, then compile, install and add to library path::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy
    $ qmake-qt4 -o ./Makefile legacy.pro
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig

Build and install the python API for pen-strokes::
    
    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy-wrappers
    $ python setup.py build
    $ sudo python setup.py install

Pen stroke test data has to be extracted::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/tests
    $ tar xvfz v0-1-0.tar.gz

Load a file with pen-stroke test data::

    >>> import stopeight_clibs_legacy
    >>> line = stopeight_clibs_legacy.parse_file('/path/to/where/FILENAME.sp')
    >>> print line

As you can see you have now loaded the raw data of a pen-stroke. Any arc-wise connected series of 2D points can be loaded but you have to provide your own GUI at the time being. The test files have been generated with a Wacom Cintiq 21UX using the editor binary.

To extract the feature points from the pen-stroke::

    >>> points = stopeight_clibs_legacy.stroke_spirals(line)
    >>> print points
