stopeight-clibs analyzer
------------------------

As of 08/2016 python version 3.5, qt5 and Ubuntu 16.04 have been tested.

If you installed qt-creator version 5 you already have them::

    $ sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev qt5-default

And the GCC compiler (>=4.9) and tools::

    $ sudo apt-get install g++ make libboost-dev

AMD's reference implementation for CPU-only SYCL::

    $ git clone https://github.com/amd/triSYCL.git

stopeight-clibs. Get::

    $ git clone https://github.com/specpose/stopeight-clibs.git

Run qmake to generate the Makefile, then compile, install and add to library path::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy
    $ QT_SELECT=qt5 qmake -o ./Makefile legacy.pro
    $ make

You may need to install them to your system's library path::

    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig

Do the same for analyzer::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/analyzer
    $ QT_SELECT=qt5 qmake -o ./Makefile analyzer.pro
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig

You will need python development headers::

    $ sudo apt-get install python3.5-dev

Build and install the python API for pen-strokes::
    
    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight-clibs/legacy-wrappers
    $ python setup.py build

You may need to install the wrappers to the system's python path::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

Most of the development tools are accessible from the scripts in the stopeight repository::

    $ cd /path/to/where/stopeight

Try to apply algorithms to a series of points from within the Editor::

    >>> exec('stopeight/analyzer/editor.py')
