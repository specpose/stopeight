\section{Vector Graph}
Consider a function that produces a sequence of independent vectors with coordinates $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$.
\begin{equation}
Anything \rightarrow \{(x,y)_{m}\}_{m \in \mathbb{N}}
\end{equation}
Note: It is a vector space with the Euclidean norm $((X,\mathbb{R}^2,\oplus,\odot),\norm{\cdot}_2)$.\\\\
The Vector Graph of the sequence of vectors is its appended form. The vectors are translated by the preceding ones.\\
\begin{equation}
vectorgraph_{1}: (x,y)_{m=n}=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x,y)_{i}
\end{equation}
Note: The vector space preserves the taxicab norm $(((X,\mathbb{R}^2,\oplus,\odot),\norm{\cdot}_2),\norm{\cdot}_1)$.
\section{Partitioning}
The appended form can, but does not have to be, subdivided into $n$ partitions of blocksize $j=m/n$ with $m\mod j=0$. The vectors in the partition are sumed and the resulting vector is stretched by the effective length of the taxicab norm of the vectors in the partition.
\begin{align}
partitioning: (((X,\mathbb{R}^2,\oplus,\odot),\norm{\cdot}_2),\norm{\cdot}_1) \rightarrow (((X,\mathbb{R}^2,\oplus,\odot),\norm{\cdot}_2),\norm{\cdot}_1)\\
partitioning: vectorgraph_{1} \mapsto vectorgraph_{m/j}\\
vectorgraph_{m/j}:(x,y)_{n}=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\underbrace{\norm{(x,y)_{(i+1)*m/j}}_{1} - \norm{(x,y)_{i*m/j}}_{1}}_{length} * \underbrace{\frac{\sum_{k=i*m/j}^{(i+1)*m/j} (x,y)_{k}}{\vert \sum_{k=i*m/j}^{(i+1)*m/j} (x,y)_{k} \vert}}_{direction})
\end{align}
Algorithm Version: Affine 2D scaling transformation (to be disclosed)\\\\
This ensures that the traversal distances are preserved!
\begin{equation}
(vectorgraph_{m/j_{1}},\norm{\cdot}_{1})=(vectorgraph_{m/j_{2}},\norm{\cdot}_{1})
\end{equation}
\chapter{Vector-length Variant}
Variance can be dealt with, because the ~\cite[Stopeight\_Analyzer.tex]{Analyzer} seamlessly ignores missing values. A variant version is composed of a sequence of $p$ Vector Graph pieces on the same taxicab norm $(\{X_{p}\}_{p\in \mathbb{Z}},\norm{\cdot}_1)$.
\section{Equalising Length}
It may be desirable to work with vectors of the same length. This may be required for inverting the Vector Graph $vectorgraph^{-1}$ or comparing two different Vector Graphs.\\\\
To avoid interpolation, integer multiples of the vector lengths over all pieces would have to be used.
\begin{equation}
\sup \limits _{\{X_{p}\}} \sqrt{(x^2+y^2)} \mod \inf \limits _{X} \sqrt{(x^2+y^2)} = 0
\end{equation}
Clearly, choosing a blocksize $j$ that results in a Euclidean distance smaller than the highest Euclidean distance in a particular section of the entire sequence $\{X_{p}\}$ is not recommended for comparison because of the missing data in that particular section.
\begin{equation}
(m/j)*\inf \limits _{X} \sqrt{(x^2+y^2)} \geq \sup \limits _{\{X_{p}\}} \sqrt{(x^2+y^2)}\label{eq:4}
\end{equation}

\chapter{Usage Scenarios}
Notation: The rest of the proceedings in this paper includes the preliminary stage of creating a Vector Graph $(x,y)_{n}$ from a signal (function of one variable) $s(t)$.
\section{Domain (Time) Scalability}
This $relative$ Vector Graph has to be constructed from a signal $s(t)\in \mathbb{R}$ by appending vectors to each other.
\begin{align}
waveform_{m/j}: (x,y)_{n}=\sum \limits _{i=0}^{n-1}(Re(z_{i}),Im(z_{i}))
\end{align}
The complex numbers $z_{n}$ are obtained from a Polar to Cartesian transform. The angles are scaled to the maximum expected angle in the specific vectorgraph.
\begin{align}
z_{n}=\sum \limits _{i=n*m/j}^{(n+1)*m/j}r_{i}\cos(\phi_{i})+r_{i}\mathrm{i}\sin(\phi_{i})\\
\phi_{n}=\frac{s(t_{n})-s(t_{n-1})}{\sup \lvert s(t_{m})-s(t_{m-1}) \rvert}*\pi+\phi_{n-1};\phi_{0}=0\\
r_{n}=t_{n}-t_{n-1};r_{0}=0
\end{align}
Note: The convolution is a Riesz space. It multiplies a factor on both sides $(X,+,*,\leq)$.
\subsection{Finding Bounds}
In a one dimensional mixed signal $s(t)$, there are quiet, low frequencies. They are difficult to spot because of the presence of high frequency noise. Creating a Vector Graph provides a high precision solution to the adequate time-localisation of these pulses, and even half pulses where the wavelength is not known.
\subsection{Pitch}
The benefit of this method is that a sequence of variable wavelength pulses can be compared at different pitches. The unbound independent scalar is exposing a wavelength/amplitude correlation (unlike just amplitude; See \eqref{eq:3}).
\subsection{Compression}
Image Variance (to be disclosed).
\section{Image (Amplitude) Scalability}
This $absolute$ Vector Graph has to be constructed by appending vectors to each other.
\begin{align}
phaseprofile_{m/j}: (x,y)_{n}=\sum \limits _{i=0}^{n-1}(\mathrm{Re(z_{i})},\mathrm{Im(z_{i})})
\end{align}
The complex numbers $z_{n}$ are obtained from Fourier Transform of $m/j=n$ partitions (Polar to Cartesian). The frequency multiplier is set to the frame size.
\begin{align}
z_{n}= \sum \limits _{i=n*(m/j)}^{(n+1)*(m/j)} s(t_{i})*(\cos(\frac{2\pi}{m/j}t_{i})+\mathrm{i}\sin(\frac{2\pi}{m/j}t_{i}))\label{eq:3}
\end{align}
Note: There is a leaking effect if the block size $m/j$ is not an integer multiple of the period of the signal $s(t)$ ~\cite[Fensterfunktion]{Fensterfunktion}. To some extent this can be solved by adjusting the partition size $m/j$ according to visibility and isolation in ~\cite[Stopeight\_Comparator.tex]{Comparator}\\\\
Note: The convolution is a Riesz space. It multiplies a factor on both sides $(X,+,*,\leq)$.
\subsection{Harmonics}
The benefit of this method is that an audio feature in a mixed signal $s(t)$ can test positive in geometric overlay comparison regardless of the amplitude of the feature.
