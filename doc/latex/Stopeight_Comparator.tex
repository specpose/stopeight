Initially the aim of this paper was to make a dataset from each of two $separated$ signal sources comparable. The sources stem from two mixed signals, becoming comparable using geometric overlay comparison (currently implemented). Following the simple time-based example in the Sphinx docs, this happens regardless of the scale of correlated time and amplitude stretch, but preserving frequency modulation and amplitude ratios (More in theory of Grapher).\\
It has now become evident that the methods in this paper can provide the $separation$ task itself to some extent. The content of this paper now generally applies to datasets in the Cartesian plane. Specifically it refers to addition operations in the Complex plane, such as the Fourier integrands in Stopeight Grapher\cite{Grapher}[1.1] .\\
In the course of specifying the Stopeight Analyzer transversality, which serves as foundation for the subsequent procedures, some more aspects have taken shape. These aspects are encapsulated in the definition Isolation and Visibility. They are an indication of the fractal dimension ~\cite{Widon} and cutoff of the approximation. On the other hand the methods described in Antis \cite{Antis} may provide an alternative separation indicator not relying on the Stopeight Analyzer transversality.\\
Finally, the role of Compact Covers has become part of a speculation, that signals ultimately need bounds of a maximal polynomial degree for comparison and that the Turns $T_{4}$ and Corners $C_{4}$ could be viable for neural networks. The reason for this assumption is founded on the theory that the Stopeight Analyzer transversality exhibits a Causal Structure.

\chapter{Multiresolution Spectrogram}
Visibility and Isolation can be calculated on multiple resolutions between all possible bounds $a,b$. The resolutions are based on summing block size (Visibility) and straightness calibration (Isolation). They disappear at the maximum resolution, which is the Aproximation where nothing is straight (Visibility) and the Vector Graph where the summing block size is 1 (Isolation).

\chapter{Partial Derivatives}
Visibility and Isolation are covariant. To address this issue we keep straightness calibration $polygon n=\infty$ in Isolation and summing block size $j=1$ in Visibility respectively fixed.

\section{Fake Visibility}
For every resolution, a Vector Graph has to be calculated and the Stopeight Analyzer applied.
Visibility is the integral of the absolute difference of the input and approximation.
\begin{equation}
isolation_{m/2^j}(a,b)=\int \limits _{a}^{b} \xi(t)\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dt}} \mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
For a Spiral this would be a viable solution.
For a ZigZag, the Edges would start shifting.
For a Swell, the Crests, together with the Edges induce massive shifting.
This approach is not viable.

\section{Fake Isolation}
For every resolution, the Stopeight Analyzer for $vectorgraph_{1}$ has to be recalibrated. $V$ is the intersection of the focal axis and the base-line $S,E$.
Isolation is the integral of the absolute difference of the focal intersection and the approximation.
\begin{align}
visibility_{m/2^j}(a,b)= \int \limits _{a}^{b} \vert \xi(t)-\iota_{V}(t)\vert  \mathrm{d}t
\end{align}
For a Spiral type Compact Cover, the transversality is irregular.
\begin{align*}
\iota_{V}(t) =
\begin{cases}
(S,V_{0}) & t \in [t(S),t(C_{4})]\\
(V_{0},V_{1}, ... , V_{n}) & t \in [t(C_{4}),t(C_{4})]\\
(V_{n},E) & t \in [t(C_{4}),t(E)]
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
For a Swell or a ZigZag type Compact Cover, the transversality is as expected.
\begin{align*}
\iota_{V}(t) =
\begin{cases}
(S,V_{0},E) & t \in [t(S),t(E)]\\
(S,V_{1},E) & t \in [t(S),t(E)]\\
...\\
(S,V_{n},E) & t \in [t(S),t(E)]\\
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
This is true if the outer bounds $S_{0},E_{n}$ of the Compact Cover are enforced. $t_{0}$ and $t_{m}$ have to be aligned with these bounds.
This approach is also not viable.

\section{Simulation}
In order to get from function graph analysis to the Stopeigh Analyzer, geometric analysis was required. In order to understand Visibility and Isolation, the Stopeight Analyzer is not enough, and some of the phenomena in Simulation have to be looked at beforehand.

A $backside dune$ has a hill-shape figure on the frontside and a straight section on the backside. The dune has a Visibility which does not change in a short time-frame. The wind is blowing sand over the hill-top and Isolation breaks up on the straight part. There is a cause and effect relationship between $neighboring$ segments.

A $backside crest$ in the formation of ocean swell creates gravitational energy on the backside of multiple wave-packets which in turn modifies the surface tension on the frontside of the same wave-packets. There is a cause and effect relationship between $neighboring$ sections, but it affects all the wave packets in the wave-train. In an electronic circuit, this would have to be implemented using a feedback convolution.

A $carriage wheel$ can get hitched if it bumps against a tree-root. Prediciting where this increased Visibility will reduce the Isolation of the wheel can not be ultimately concluded, just by looking at the wheel. There is only a probability that the wheel will start to break, when it encounters a backward thrust against its wooden spines. It is therefore not at all a neighboring relationship of cause and effect.

\chapter{Coordinate Transform}

If you would happen to try to run the Stopeight Analyzer recursively on a ZigZag, you would find out that you get a valid result from the output as well, because the output from the Stopeight Analyzer still contains original points from $\iota_{X}$ (except for inserted Corners in Straights). But acknowledge that theoretically you would have treated Turns as Corners (see Spiral). The result is that you are realigning focal axes. Essentially you would have increased the polynomial degree of the approximation, but this is not desirable in ZigZags. As an alternative you could try the Woodpecker Transform on a ZigZag (needs computational verification).

If you would happen to look for a signal expansion on a coordinate transform in a Spiral, you would probably try to look for a common center of all the Cliffs. You would then have a function $\phi of r$, which would have an analytic meaning, for example on a signal base $e^ik;k \in I$.

Even though Visibility and Isolation are present in the two examples above ($Visibility=0$ for ZigZag and $Visibility=\infty=k2\pi$ for a repeating perfect circle), they $directly$ depend on each other only in Swells.

\chapter{Vector Graph Inverses}
\section{Graph Inverse}
The full resolution $vectorgraph_{1}$ is considered. Start of the signal $s(t);t=0$ and end of the signal $s(t);t=m$ are needed.
\begin{equation}
(vectorgraph_{1})^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
The signal reconstruction is lossless, albeit normalized.
\section{Approximation Inverse}
Start of the signal, end of the signal and approximation $\xi(t)$ are needed for interpolation. There is a loss of information in Arcs $A$ caused by Straights and Spikes.
\begin{equation}
vectorgraph^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
\end{equation}
It is possible to reconstruct a signal from the approximation, effectively making it a suitable format for compression or even upsampling. It can also make Vector Graphs, which have not been obtained from a signal, audible or suitable for 1-dimensional analysis.\\
Note: The compression is dynamic. In some cases, the data may actually increase.



\chapter{After Separation}
Asymetric, non-repetitive half-pulses, which can be compared by matchline overlay comparison.\\\\
Sisyphus: A Foray into Fractals\\
Let's take the example of Sisyphus rolling a rock up a parabolic hill. We measure the altitude of the rock as a function of time. Sisyphus will roll the rock up the hill much slower than it will roll down the hill. Therefore variance of the Vector Graph in one direction is much lower than going in the other direction, but the periodicity of the falling depends on the rising.\\
If we compare this to the formation of mountain ridges and their erosion, we can still say they depend on each other, but the periodicity is much more disconnected. The formation of mountain ridges depends on the flow of magma and ultimately on the thermomagnetic energy within the planet. Erosion, however depends on a much shorter period, which depends on the availability of atmosphere and ocean and the electromagnetic energy directed at them by the sun.\\
The Vector Graph is non-symmetric in regard of time. Because phase varies there is no frequency; We speak of periodicity. An acoustic impulse propagates symmetrically as it oscillates between two fixed values. We can therefore assume that it has a fixed variance in both directions. This criteria is not true for our geological example. We may have to use different means to find correlations. This is where the Stopeight Comparator comes in handy.\\
