Multiprocessing
===============

requestProcessing is using the Python multiprocessing module. You can test if your Python installation and the underlying OS support this by running from within a Python shell::

        from multiprocessing import synchronize

Windows 64-Bit
==============

Installing 64-Bit Python (version 2.7.3) in a 64-Bit Windows Environment is not recommended if you intend to install packages that require to be built natively.
The build scripts require cl.exe which can only be found in Windows XP and 2003, read:

Also you need to download Windows SDK (=7.1) and Visual Studio C++ Express 2008 to get a 100% 64bit toolchain:

The standard setuptools installer is also not working, you need to download the ez_setup.py script from:

http://packages.python.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html

According to the article above using Mingw can also be problematic.

Windows 32-Bit
==============

If you choose to use the 32-Bit Python you should be able to fetch precompiled packages using easy_setup and pip, however this has not been tested.

A general guide on installing Python binaries with screenshots can be found here:

Mac OSX
=======

If you are using OSX Lion you have to download the Command Line Tools from the 'Apple Developer site <http://developer.apple.com>' to get a working compiler.
In OSX Mountain Lion you should be able to download them from within the Xcode Preferences.

Linux or BSD
============

I have tested installing all of the dependencies from within Ubuntu 12.04 and Gentoo (March 2012) repositories.

Usually they have more up-to date packages with bug-fixes which should be preferred over the pip/easy_setup packages.

The dependencies should compile and install out-of-the box within a few minutes.

Using pip and easy_setup
========================

It's usually faster and easier to use pip to install the python requirements for matchline. It's as easy as::

    $ easy_install pip
    $ pip install ZSI
    $ pip install ZODB3


Different Storage Setups
========================

You can switch to a SQL storage backend by modifying 3 lines of code. Change occurences of::

    "from zodbTools import DBLine"

to::

    "from elixirTools import DBLine"

and change the database connection string in elixirTools according to you database installation. I have successfully tested MySQL. The elixir code follows the rails ActiveRecord convention.

You will also need to::

    $ pip install mysql-python
    $ pip install elixir
